Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) Software Support Package v6.1.0


DESCRIPTION

   The PRU Software Support Package (PSSP) is an add-on package that provides a framework
   and examples for developing software for the Programmable Real-time Unit
   sub-system and Industrial Communication Sub-System (PRU-ICSS) in the supported
   TI processors.  The PRU-ICSS achieves deterministic, real-time processing, direct
   access to I/Os and meets ultra-low-latency requirements.

   This software package contains example PRU firmware code as well as application
   loader code for the host OS. The examples demonstrate the PRU capabilities to
   interact with and control the system and its resources.

   See Release_Notes.txt for details about this specific PSSP version.
